# Moore–Penrose Pseudoinverse and SVD Applications

This repository contains a university project demonstrating the use of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in data analysis, image compression, and LiDAR surface approximation.

The goal is to show how these fundamental linear algebra concepts can be applied to real-world datasets — from visualizing geometric SVD transformations to reconstructing ground surfaces from LiDAR data using least-squares approximation.
